# linked-list.js
#### create an arbitray SLL and remove provided value (offset).

## Overview

- implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure
- implement remove(offset) methods to the SLL class
- offset is an integer representing how many nodes to traverse before removal
- the head of the linked lists represents offset 0
- in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime


### Prerequisites

Example:
```
linkedListCopy.run.find(8); 
```
This will run through the link list that is a set of 10 generated numbers and removed the entry 8 and link the current next (link) back to the tail of the list.

### Tests Performed with Jest
- This is a very simple program that only creates and checks for numbers in a SLL

### Installing

To use this in your code:

- git clone repo 
- npm install 
- require('../src/lib/linked-lists')
